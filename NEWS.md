# mnirs 0.6.4

## Bug fix

* Fix a memory allocation bug with `resample_mnirs`. Downsampling 100k rows now allocates ~11MB rather than ~4.5 GB.


# mnirs 0.6.3

## Plotting improvements

* Generic `plot.mnirs()` ncan now be called on a list of *"mnirs"* data frames. Each data frame will be printed as a facet. This is primarily useful for printing a list of interval data frames exported from `extract_intervals()`:

``` r
read_mnirs() |> 
    extract_intervals() |> 
    plot()
## returns a plot with a facet for each interval
```

* To faciliate this, `extract_intervals()` now returns a list of data frames with `class = "mnirs"`. Otherwise, to manually plot a list of data frames, it will need to have `class(list) <- c("mnirs", class(list))` edited manually.

``` r
read_mnirs() |> 
    extract_intervals() |> 
    class()
#> [1] "mnirs" "list"
```

* Backend improvement: `print.mnirs()` generic created to avoid displaying extra `NextMethod()` calls when printing lists with `class = "mnirs"`.

## Modified lap extraction behaviour

* `extract_intervals()`: 

    * When specifying `start` and `end` with `by_lap()`, `start` will only refer to the first sample of the lap, and `end` the last sample.

    * With previous behaviour, `start = by_lap()` would include the entire specified lap(s). But this resulted in less control over displaying only parts of a lap.
    
    * Updated behaviour is now more consistent with `by_time`, `by_label`, and `by_sample()` methods, which reference `start` and `end` from a single sample. This allows extraction of e.g. only the first 60-sec of lap:

```r
read_mnirs() |> 
    extract_intervals(
        start = by_lap(1, 3),
        span = c(0, 60),
    )
## returns a list of two intervals with the first 60-sec of laps 1 and 3, respectively.
```

## Updated core functions

* `read_mnirs()`: Fix detection issue with *"PerfPro"* file formats, and another small bug fix to improve timestamp parsing.

* `create_mnirs_data()` now properly accepts tidy evaluation for `nirs_channels`, `time_channel`, and `event_channel`:

```r
create_mnirs_data(df, nirs_channels = c(o2hb, hhb))
```

* `resample_mnirs()`: 

    * Now resamples to an inclusive time range around existing data, rounded to the nearest resampled rate. Better handles edge cases where the last sample was being dropped in certain rounding conditions.

    * Fix an edge case error when `sample_rate` was mis-specified higher than the actual sample_rate of the data. Now more robustly fills non-numeric columns.


# mnirs 0.6.2

## Core updates

* `read_mnirs()`: 
    
    * Now properly parses `time_channel` as fractional unix values; i.e. timestamp (e.g. "hh:mm:ss") values are saved by Excel in all its infinite wisdom as numeric fractional Unix timestamps. Will now be properly coerced to numeric and POSIXct timestamp values can be returned.

    * Timestamps should now be returned in the user's local time zone.

## Core function argument changes

* `resample_mnirs()`: Update default `method = "none"`. Less opinionated default to force users to explicitly opt-in to specifying either "linear" or "locf" methods to fill/interpolate across new samples. Updated package documentation.

* `replace_invalid()`, `replace_outliers()`, `replace_missing()`: Remove `bypass_checks` arg intended for internal use only, to bypass redundant checks when calling from `replace_mnirs()`.

## Small edits

* `plot.mnirs()`: No longer coerces to long format data behind the scenes.

* `plot.mnirs()`: y-axis title changed from "signal" to "mNIRS".

* Fix lap marker inconsistency in `train.red_intervals.csv`. Updated relevant interval times in documentation.

* `README.md` & *"reading-mnirs-data.qmd"* vignette updates.

    * Update recommended core processing sequence: `read_mnirs()` -> `resample_mnirs()` -> `replace_mnirs()` -> ...

    * Update `extract_intervals()` vignette to `train.red_intervals.csv` end-interval reoxygenation events.

* Small documentation changes.


# mnirs 0.6.1

## Bug fixes

* Core functions updated to accept `nirs_channel` args as a list. 
    
    * An info message will be displayed when a list is not required, instead of erroring.
    
    * Additional info messages will be displayed for `shift_mnirs()`, `rescale_mnirs()`, and `extract_intervals()` when `nirs_channels` has not been specified as a list, nor retrieved from metadata. As a reminder of the grouping requirements in those functions.

* Core functions now properly update `nirs_channels` metadata when re-specified.
    
    * Previously, specifying `nirs_channels` in a function would only add any additional column name strings to the existing metadata rather than overwrite it. Meaning `nirs_channels` could only be removed from metadata by using `create_mnirs_data(nirs_channels = "...")`. The updated behaviour should mean channels need to be re-specified less often.

* `filter_mnirs()`: Fixed an error matching `method` arguments when left blank.

* *README* and *"Reading and Cleaning Data with {mnirs}"* vignette updated to fix typos and small edits.

# mnirs 0.6.0

## Prepare for CRAN submission

* *NEWS.md* is truncated to the most recent relevant release updates. The full *NEWS.md* remains in the `dev` branch.

* Some development functions have been omitted from the package build in expectation of CRAN review. They are still present in `dev` branch and can be installed with `pak::pak("jemarnold/mnirs")`.

### Updated core functions

* `filter_mnirs()`: Method-specific arguments (e.g. `order` for `method = "butterworth"`, or `width` for `method = "moving_average"`) removed from the generic function call. Continue to be passed to the appropriate method via `...`. Documentation and info/warning/abort messages updated.

* `filter_ma()` better separates effects of `partial` and `na.rm` args:
    
    * `partial = FALSE` by default returns NA at edges where insufficient number of samples are available compared to the specified `width` or `span`.
    
    * `partial = TRUE` calculates mean values at edges, as long as one valid non-`NA` sample is available.
    
    * `na.rm = FALSE` by default behaves as expected with `mean(na.rm = FALSE)`, propagating any `NA`s in the local window to the calculated mean with a warning.
        
        * **NOTE** This differs from the behaviour of `na.rm = FALSE` in `filter_butter()`, which errors if there are any internal `NA`s present. This has not been changed.
    
    * `na.rm = TRUE` ignores `NA`s and calculates local means as long as one valid sample is present.

* `plot.mnirs()`
    
    * Add new arg: `points = TRUE` will plot points in addition to lines, as a useful quick shortcut.
    
    * Update `na.omit` now omits non-valid `c(NA, NaN, Inf, -Inf)` values from plotting, not just `NA`.

* `palette_mnirs()` can now accept either a single numeric value specifying the number of colours to return, or any number of (valid) character colour names.


# mnirs 0.5.2

### Shiny app

* Update online shiny app hosted at <https://jemarnold-mnirs-app.share.connect.posit.cloud/> with basic reading and pre-processing functionality.

# mnirs 0.5.1

### Updated core functions

* `read_mnirs()` now has better automated channel detection logic for *"Artinis" / "Oxysoft"* file formats. `nirs_channels` and `time_channel` can be left blank to automatically *"sample"*, *"time"* (from `sample_rate`), and nirs channel *"2"*.

* `replace_outliers()` now accepts numeric `outlier_cutoff` values for more precise outlier detection thresholds (previously was integers only). Documentation also updated.


# mnirs 0.5.0

### Updated core functions

* `read_mnirs()` expands `event_channel` to work with integer *"lap"* numbers, or character event label as previous.
    
    * Should now work on more .csv file formats; previously read errors may have occured where the file contained header rows above the data table, resulting in improper detection of columns.
    
    * `event_channel` can now be specified as an integer `lap` column, in addition to a character column as previous.
    
    * Other {mnirs} functions may expect `event_channel` to be either character or integer-ish.

* `extract_intervals()`:
    
    * Function arguments `start` and `end` are used to specify one or both of a start and end point to the target interval.
    
    * Specify `start`/`end` values with helper functions `by_time()`, `by_label()`, `by_lap()`, and `by_sample()`.
    
    * Numeric values are automatically coerced to "time" values; Explicit integer values (e.g. `2L`) are coerced to "lap"; Character strings are coerced to event "label".

### Package resources

* A rough draft *{mnirs}* hex icon and package cheatsheet have been added.
